**ASTONISHINGLY IMPORTANT NOTES**
--This game is not finished, if you feel like you've hit a dead end, you probably have. More to come soon (I hope!).
--This game will edit one singular .txt file in the directory that the main.py and/or main.exe are in. Don't move anything out of anywhere.

Welcome!

This is my classic self-taught / beginner programmer project: the quintessential text-based adventure (more like a text-based experience).

Disclaimer:
This is a horror game. Itâ€™s not going to keep you up at night, but there are some vaguely creepy moments and a bit of  vile language if you look closely. Player discretion is advised.

How to Run

Starting this thing up is pretty simple, there's the classic approach (In your terminal):

# (Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv  

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt  

# Run the game
# Windows
python main.py  

# Mac / Linux
python3 main.py  


Note: I have yet to test this on Mac or Linux so please let me know if and what to fix.

Optionally, there is a .exe file in the dist directory, easy plug and play for Windows and (maybe?) Mac. Not Linux yet but I'll make an easy Linux executable soon.
